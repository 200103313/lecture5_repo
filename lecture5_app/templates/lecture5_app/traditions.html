                <p>A wedding is an important stage in<br>
                    the life of any person, but for the<br>
                    Kazakhs it is an even more important event,<br>
                    which is accompanied by a huge number of<br>
                    customs and rituals. Long before the wedding,<br>
                    the parents of the future newlyweds conspire.<br>
                    This is followed by matchmaking and the<br>
                    payment of "kalym" for the bride.<br>
                    The wedding itself is also divided into two:<br>
                    a wedding at the bride's house and<br>
                    a wedding at the groom's house.</p>

                <p>Family for Kazakhs is the basis of life.<br>
                    Family relations, the upbringing of children,<br>
                    the principle of family ties - all this is reflected<br>
                    in the special customs and traditions of the Kazakh people.<br>
                    The principle of "zheti ata", according to which one<br>
                    should know seven generations of one's ancestors,<br>
                    as well as indicating the continuation of the family<br>
                    line through the paternal line. There were special<br>
                    rules in the upbringing of children, and significant<br>
                    events in the life of a child were accompanied<br>
                    by peculiar Kazakh rituals.</p>

                <p>The everyday life of the Kazakhs was filled<br>
                    with many minor but very interesting traditions,<br>
                    which formed a unique ethnic culture.<br>
                    The people had customs and traditions<br>
                    that were used at home, on the street, at important events.<br>
                    There were also various games that also<br>
                    became folk traditions - children's<br>
                    street games, horse games, etc.</p>

                <p>The Kazakhs are a nomadic people who<br>
                    today have switched to a settled way of life,<br>
                    but carefully preserve their traditions that<br>
                    have been formed over thousands of years.<br>
                    Constant travel across the endless steppes,<br>
                    life in small groups, peculiarities of<br>
                    religious beliefs - all this created a unique<br>
                    set of rituals and customs, which today are<br>
                    commonly called the traditions of Kazakhstan.<br>
                    Some traditions helped develop practical survival<br>
                    skills, others had a sacred meaning, some were<br>
                    created to develop relationships and socialization,<br>
                    and some became the basis for the formation of the<br>
                    culture of the Kazakh people and their identity.</p>
